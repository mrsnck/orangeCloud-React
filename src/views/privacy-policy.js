                The contents of our pages were created with great care. However,
                we cannot assume any liability for the correctness, completeness
                and topicality of the content. As a service provider, we are
                responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance
                with general law in accordance with Section 7 (1) of the German
                Telemedia Act. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, as a service
                provider, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored
                third-party information or to research circumstances that
                indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the
                use of information according to general laws remain unaffected.
                However, liability in this regard is only possible from the
                point in time at which we become aware of a specific legal
                violation. As soon as we become aware of such legal violations,
                we will remove this content immediately.

              <span>Liability for links</span>
              <br></br>
              <span>
                Our offer contains links to external third-party websites over
                whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot accept
                any liability for this third-party content. The respective
                provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the
                content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for
                possible legal violations at the time they were linked. No
                illegal content was found at the time the link was created.
                However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages
                is unreasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the
                law. As soon as we become aware of legal violations, we will
                remove such links immediately.

                should nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, we
                ask for a hint. If we become aware of legal violations, we will
                remove such content immediately.
